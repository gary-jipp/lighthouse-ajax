### HTTP Protocol & HTML
- request - response
- HTML is a static page
- HTML 'live' elements (clickable):
  - Download Elements (Fetch)
  - Upload Elements (Send)
   - `<a>`
   - `<input type=submit>` (only in a form)
   -  `<button type=submit>` (only in a form)
- replaces the entire browser page   (docuement)
- That was all there was for years.  Boring!

### iFrame
- 1996 Microsoft introduced the `<iframe>` tag
- mini page within a page
- the beginning of a new concept in web pages
- mini-requests

###  XMLHttpRequest (XHR)
 - Originally developed for Microsoft Outlook
 - Included in IE in 2000
 - the term ajax was coined in 2006
 - uses the `XMLHttpRequest` object
 - not the easiest code to write
